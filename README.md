# MFG-RL-PIDL

This is the source code for paper - A Hybrid Framework of Reinforcement Learning and Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Mean Field Games.

## How to Run

```
python MFG.py # hyperparams set by default
```

## Branch

- **main** - DRL & PIDL model for ring road MFG (take x,t index as input)
- **timeless-test** - DRL & PIDL model for ring road MFG (take rho as input). See playground.ipynb. ***WIP***
